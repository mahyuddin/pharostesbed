This is the software used by the Proteus robots in the Pharos
Mobile Computing Laboratory at UT.  The software is modularized into the
following directories:

 - MCU: This is the code that runs on the 9S12 micro-controller. This is 
   written in C.
 
 - MCU-SimonSays: This is the 9S12 MCU code for the Simon Says demo.

 - MCU-AutoInt: This is the 9S12 MCU code for the Autonomous Intersection demo.

 - ProteusDriver: This is the Player Driver that allows the Player
   middleware to communicate with the robot's MCU.  The Player middleware
   provides basic access to robot sensors and actuators, e.g., movement
   and sensing commands.  This is written in C/C++.

 - Mote: This is the software that runs on the TelosB mote, which contains
   a MSP430 MCU and 802.15.4 wireless interface.  It is written in NesC,
   and requires the TinyOS operating system.
   
 - PharosMiddleware: This is the middleware that runs on top of Player and
   provides higher-level operations.  For example, it helps coordinate
   the start of a multi-robot GPS-based navigation experiment, and performs
   GPS-based waypoint navigation.  This is written in Java.

 - Scripts: This contains scripts that are useful for parsing the log
   files generated by the Pharos Middleware.

 - Utils: Contains small programs that are useful for running multi-robot 
   experiments.
